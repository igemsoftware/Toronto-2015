## Navigation
Network diagrams are dynamically arranged into a forced-layout. Node positions can be changed by clicking and dragging a node. Upon initialization, only species nodes, metabolites and reactions nodes are rendered. To access internal metabolites and reactions, click the enter button which hovers over species nodes. Panning and zooming of the network is also supported by using the mouse wheel or trackpad.
