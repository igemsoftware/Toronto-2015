* storyline
* integration with project
* integration with wetlab
* chart
* edit and display mode
* selectively show certain nodes/reactions
* optimize button
* compartmentalized
* *why* we are doing FBA
* more marketing
* presentation team -> **Sep. 11 presentation**
* twist -> sell
* the reason to use it
* nothing stands out
* tags -> diagram
* easy to use, understand, pretty UI
* focus on FBA
* **problem, hypothesis, solution, results**
* the state of science
* current methods and their limitations (us vs. Kbase narratives vs. others)
* rapid advances
* ahhhhhhhhhhhh
* highthroughput sequeuncing is recent, needs methods to analyze (no web
  software for this)
* transition into application for bioremediation with wet lab
* our modeling -> influenced tod-E for wet lab
* recent advances
* transition into P&P

### General presentation structure

*note: presentation is 20mins, with time for questions afterwards. We can use
question time to sneak in more details that are not included in the presentation.
The judges will use our wiki to found out more, so the presentation should be
snappy, effective, and leave you wanting more (FBA)*

1. Problem statement
    * why their needs to be this tool vs. old which was "bioremediation of tailings ponds" (but don't worry, we'll get to that)
2. Introduction to FBA, MetaFlux
    * should explain what FBA does, not how (ref. our wiki for how)
    * quickly go through the points about MetaFlux with regards to meeting the medal requirements. Be clear and concise.
    * Quick MetaFlux video demo
3. Transition into the application of our tool with regards to our wet lab team. We found bioremediation of tailings ponds to be a problem that requires solving, but were not entirely convinced the introduction of a gene which codes for an enzyme that will breakdown a harmful metabolite (toluene). This is because community structure and interaction is largely the primary factor to achieve bioremediation. Soooo with the use of our tool, we added the tod-E gene into an *E. Coli K12* model, and performed community flux balance analysis using our in house pipeline similar to the methods employed by Stolyar, Van Dien, et. al. in *Metabolic modelling of a mutualistic microbial community*. The results indicated, that compared to the WT *E. Coli*, toluene degredation was active, and **the community biomass objective function produced a larger value** (i.e., the community survived better)
4. Thus, we embarked upon the long and arduous task of doing wet lab stuff.
5. And then we also did some P&P stuff to support that.

### The State of MetaFlux

We have:

* display of SBML -> Cobrapy formatted models working in browsers using `D3.js` to set the `x,y` (and other) values for each metabolite and reaction, and these nodes are rendered using HTML5 canvas
* this visualization is interactive, having:
    * panning
    * zooming
    * node dragging
* furthermore, other interactive elements present within the visualization and sidebar have effects which modify the underlying metabolic model:
    * metabolite insertion/deletion
    * reaction insertion/deletion
    * **the ability to add genes from the standard parts database is required to fill the bronze requirement for Software track.** We will integrate **Easy BBK**, a project from last year, which eases query of the parts database, to achieve this, and also to build upon/use a previous project. **We need someone to figure out how to install and use Easy BBK ASAP**
* segregation of groups of metabolites + reactions
    * can view and entire species as one metabolite, and zoom into it to see internal reactions
    * need to have this sort of structure on multiple levels, using **compartments** and **subsystems**. This is to balance the eternal fight between 'showing too much data' and 'showing data in a meaningful way'
* currently, there is no optimize button. Add a backend route to take the new modify model (POST request with Content-Type:application/json) and optimize using COBRApy.
* improve UI. right now its pretty bad. Can someone can make some mockups for this using [Balsamiq mockups](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) or Photoshop. Getting screenshots of nice lookings sites helps a lot too.
* improve usability. tutorials, legend, tooltips. etc.
* write backend routes to employ our acFBA pipeline

# NO DATABASE! ;)
